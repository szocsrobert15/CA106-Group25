			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p> League of Legends (abbreviated LoL or League) is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Originally inspired by Defense of the Ancients, the game has followed a freemium model since its release on October 27, 2009. League of Legends is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene. The 2019 League of Legends World Championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million, with a minimum prize pool of US$2.5 million.

            <section id="The Game">
			<h1>The Game</h1>
			<p>In League of Legends, players form a team of five and assume the role of a champion, characters with unique abilities, generally varying around a type of class, and battle against a team of player- or computer-controlled champions. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, the goal is to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", a structure that lies at the heart of their base and is protected by defensive structures.
As in other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, each player in League of Legends controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities. Most games involve two teams of five players, with each player using a different champion. The two teams compete to be the first to destroy the Nexus structure within the opposing base.<br>
<br>Over the course of each game, champions become stronger and gain additional abilities by earning experience and thereby levelling up. Experience is earned by killing enemies (or being nearby when a teammate does). Champions also build strength over the course of the game by buying progressively more powerful items using gold, which is earned by killing non-player enemies, killing or assisting in killing enemy players, destroying enemy structures, or selling other items.
</p>

<section id="Development">
<h1>Development</h1>
<p>Company founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a spiritual successor to Defense of the Ancients that would be a stand-alone game, with its own engine instead of as another mod of Warcraft III. The two believed it could be a new genre of game, but with the advantage of a significantly lowered barrier to entry . Beck and Merill held a DOTA tournament at the University of Southern California, with an ulterior goal of recruiting interns for quality assurance, and were introduced to Jeff Jew. Jew was interviewed in September 2006 when Riot Games' offices were a converted machine shop, and they brought him on board due to his familiarity with the game and what would become its rivals. 
About two months into the game's development, Beck and Merill recruited Steve Feak, designer of the popular Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod Defense of the Ancients, and Steve Mescon, administrator of the map's support base, to develop League of Legends. At the time, most of the team had no prior experience working with other developers as a team. They created a design document with a priority towards differentiating their characters from those of Warcraft III.<br>
<br> A demonstration of the game was built in 4 months before being shown at the 2007 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. During that time, Beck and Merill approached publishers, but were unwilling to sell the game outright and could not reach any agreements. In 2019, Merill said that publishers were confused by the game's lack of a single-player, and their free-to-play business model. When it came to designing playable characters for the game, the team decided to open up the champion creation process to everyone in the company, based on a template where Feak and Mescon could decide which champions made it into the game. 
League of Legends was formally announced on October 7, 2008, and entered a closed beta on April 10, 2009. 17 champions were available upon the launch of the beta in April 2009: Alistar, Annie, Ashe, Fiddlesticks, Jax, Kayle, Master Yi, Morgana, Nunu, Ryze, Sion, Sivir, Soraka, Teemo, Tristana, Twisted Fate, and Warwick. Riot initially wanted to ship the game for its official release with 20 champions, but after doing some analysis they decided to double the number to 40 for the full release of the game in October 2009.

<section id="Tournaments">
<h1>Tournaments</h1>

<p>The greatest tournament in League of Legends history didn't happen at one of developer Riot Games' world championship events, but was hosted by IGN in Las Vegas. Storylines and narratives for future faces of League of Legends esports were born, game knowledge was freely shared across regional lines, and 6 million unique viewers tuned in to the entirety of the IPL tournament, surprisingly close to the 8.2 million who tuned into the League of Legends world championship that same year. It's a pittance compared to the 100 million of Riot's 2019 League of Legends World Championship, but was a harbinger of what was to come for LoL and esports.
On Nov. 29, 2012, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was rated as "The Best Hotel in the World." That same day, the Cosmopolitan hosted IGN's ProLeague 5 gaming tournament, featuring StarCraft II and League of Legends. After three grueling days of group and double-elimination tournament play, Team World Elite and their cunning sixth man, coach Ji "Aaron" Xing, were crowned victorious in the League of Legends tournament.
Viewers didn't know it at the time, but IPL 5 was the end of an era, a sunset on individually-organized international tournaments, with the dawn of the LCS on the horizon.

<section id="Reputation">
<h1>Reputation</h1>
<p>The playerbase of League of Legends has a longstanding reputation of negative and abusive in-game behavior, referred to in gaming media as toxicity. Riot Games has acknowledged this problem, and developed tools to combat it with mixed results. One such measure is basic report functionality, which enables players to report their teammates and opponents for violating the game's code of ethics. The report functionality has been described as "underwhelming" and can be abused by players. For example, some players utilize All Chat, a way to converse with the enemy team, or post-game chat to ask the enemy team to report their former teammates. Some professional League of Legends live streamers share the game's reputation of toxicity, such as Tyler1, who was banned by Riot Games for six hundred days in April 2016. In May 2020, former pro player Joedat "Voyboy" Esfahani called out Riot for a lack of action to tackle toxicity in high-level play. Voyboy argued that high level players are not afraid of being banned and know how to avoid the automatic chat filter. He said that, given the relatively small pool of high-level players, matchmaking forces players to play against or alongside the same toxic players repeatedly. 
Riot Games has operated a team, Social Systems, to combat in-game toxicity for several years.<br>
<br> The team utilizes neuroscience and machine learning to curb the game's toxicity problems. Lead designer of social systems Jeffrey Lin said that eliminating toxicity in a game with over 100 million players is an unrealistic goal, and the focus should instead be on rewarding good behavior. In 2017, Riot implemented an "Honor system", where players can award their teammates with medals for one of three positive attributes: Stayed Cool, Great Shotcalling, or GG Each player begins at level 2, and gains levels for playing without being reported. Ranked rewards are only available to players who have reached level five by the end of a season, and the system rewards randomized cosmetics, via loot boxes, to players ascending through honor levels. 
In-game chat is monitored by algorithms that detect abuse, ranging from racism, homophobia, and sexism, to abusive jargon specific to League. However, its effectiveness has been criticized for misunderstanding how toxicity manifests within the game.
